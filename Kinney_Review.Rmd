## Review


#Part One: Running All Code

Running all the code as is within your R_Assignment.Rmd gave me the following concerns:
First, the 4 chunk of R code has a warning that appears; this warning says:
"Warning: 'maize' already exists: 'teosinte' already exists". 

Second, there is an error that appears with line 154: "object 'SNP_ID' not found". This was resolved when I shifted line 155 to a line ahead of 154.

Code otherwise runs smoothly without issue; it can be a little slow around the 'for' loops.


#Part Two: Other Comments

Graphs:
All of the second set of graphs (for the heterozygosity section) do not appear as useful graphs: they are dark grey squares over the graphs' axis. 

Output files:
First, the Sample ID column names are V1, V2, V3, etc. Was this intentional? 
Second, the Position column values are ordered as if they are characters.  For example, in the file maize_decreasing_chr1 the position values are as follows:
95,897,171
9,300,541
9,300,391
88,863,284

Changing the column 'Position' from a character to a numerical column might fix this.


#Part Three: Overall

All comments above require minor changes; overall your code was clean, for example the use of 'for' loops was nice in order to reduce repetitive code. Good explanation of code.
